          <p id="experience">
            While still an amateur website creator and designer, I have currently made over 20 different websites for various purposes ranging from
            advertisements, informational articles, and mechanical services. I have also dwelled into the realm of pure website design
            and have styled and arranged over thirty different websites for my clientele. Most of my experience dwells into arranging and
            designing video game wikipedias to allow users to find and use even the smallest bits of information pertaining to their game
            in question, and creating original websites for indie developers to showcase their game and host their announcements, forums, and
            advertisements.

        <h2>My Biggest Projects</h2>

        <ol>

            <li><a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Terraria_Wiki">Terraria's Official Wikipedia Page</a></li>

            <p>
              My main continuous project is to maintain and expand the offical Terraria Wikipedia. It currently provides the most expansive reference to all of the mechanics, items,
              updates, and designs of Terraria. I have, alongside other creators, designed and arranged the website to provide all Terraria players a means of accessing whatever
              niche information they may like to know in one singular area of the internet.
            </p>

            <li><a href="https://calamitymod.wiki.gg/wiki/Calamity_Mod_Wiki">Calamity's Official Wikipedia Page</a></li>

            <p>
              My second continuous project is to maintain the official wikipedia page for the Calamity Mod, the biggest content mod that exists for Terraria. Similar in purpose to
              the offical Terraria wikipedia, it provides an extensive reference to all of the adjusted vanilla mechanics, new mechanics, new items, mod updates, and designs of the 
              Calamity Mod.
            </p>

            <li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/">Nexus Mods Hosting Service</a></li>

            <p>
              My last project is to continuously maintain and update the visual design of Nexus Mods, a vast hosting service for player created mods for various games. Unlike my 
              other two projects, in this one, I am only tasked with moderating and maintaining the visual elements of the website, making sure that it stays up to standard and 
              consistency.

              "I love the way he made our offical wikipedia. It's easy to navigate, it's very inclusive and responsive to all of Terraria's updates, and I really like the
              visual design that was made for it as it complements Terraria's colors. The website has proven to be very useful for our players and it's very nice to have someplace
              to go to find whatever our players would like to know about my game."

              "I already had good expectations when I saw his creation for Terraria's official wikipedia page, and I was not disappointed to see the work put for me. I asked him to
              maintain a similar look and structure to Terraria's wikipage for my mod except that he tailors it to Calamity's color scheme, and he did not disappoint. I love having
              a central area for my mod users to find information about my mod because even I forget things sometimes."

              and I appreciate that he keeps it up to par as we add more and more to it. It's a website that requires consistent attention and the work given is truly appreciated. I
              can definitely recommend his visual design and experience."
