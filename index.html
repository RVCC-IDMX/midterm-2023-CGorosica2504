            While still an amateur website creator and designer, I have currently made over 20 different websites for various purposes ranging from
            advertisements, informational articles, and mechanical services. I have also dwelled into the realm of pure website design
            and have styled and arranged over thirty different websites for my clientele. Most of my experience dwells into arranging and
            designing video game wikipedias to allow users to find and use even the smallest bits of information pertaining to their game
            in question, and creating original websites for indie developers to showcase their game and host their announcements, forums, and
            advertisements.
