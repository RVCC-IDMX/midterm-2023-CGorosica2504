          <p>
            While still an amateur website creator and designer, I have currently made over 20 different websites for various purposes ranging from
            advertisements, informational articles, and mechanical services. I have also dwelled into the realm of pure website design
            and have styled and arranged over thirty different websites for my clientele. Most of my experience dwells into arranging and
            designing video game wikipedias to allow users to find and use even the smallest bits of information pertaining to their game
            in question, and creating original websites for indie developers to showcase their game and host their announcements, forums, and
            advertisements.

        <h2>My Biggest Projects</h2>

        <ol>

            <li><a href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Terraria_Wiki">Terraria's Official Wikipedia Page</a></li>

            <p>
              My main continuous project is to maintain and expand the offical Terraria Wikipedia. It currently provides the most expansive reference to all of the mechanics, items,
              updates, and designs of Terraria. I have, alongside other creators, designed and arranged the website to provide all Terraria players a means of accessing whatever
              niche information they may like to know in one singular area of the internet.
            </p>

            <li><a href="https://calamitymod.wiki.gg/wiki/Calamity_Mod_Wiki">Calamity's Official Wikipedia Page</a></li>

            <p>
              My second continuous project is to maintain the official wikipedia page for the Calamity Mod, the biggest content mod that exists for Terraria. Similar in purpose to
              the offical Terraria wikipedia, it provides an extensive reference to all of the adjusted vanilla mechanics, new mechanics, new items, mod updates, and designs of the 
              Calamity Mod.
            </p>

            <li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/">Nexus Mods Hosting Service</a></li>

            <p>
              My last project is to continuously maintain and update the visual design of Nexus Mods, a vast hosting service for player created mods various games. Unlike my other two
              projects, in this one, I am only tasked with moderating and maintain the visual elements of the website, making sure that it stays up to standard and consistency.
